<h1>Average Starting Pay</h1>
	<h3>By Brian Graham. January 16, 2020.</h3>

<h2>Web and Digital Design Students</h2>	
	<p>An understanding of computer science is becoming increasingly essential in today’s world.  Every job we're going to do in the future will rely on technology.  Therefore, it is important that every student around the world be given the opportunity to learn computer science.  By starting early, students will have an opportunity to create a foundation for success in any career path. Learning how to code programs stretches your mind, helps you think better, nurtures problem-solving skills, and will enhance your creativity.</p>
	
	<p>According to Code.org, there were less than 50,000 Computer Science graduates in 2018.  But there are over 500,000 open computing positions (Links to an external site.) in the United States. If this rate continues, by 2025, the available seats for these positions will exceed qualified applicants by almost 2 million and the gap is continuing to rise.  Based on the research, there are currently more than 900,000 computer related job openings in the US right now.  Companies are finding it extremely challenging to find the right talent.  To address this shortage many tech organizations are now turning to applicants with little to no experience and providing their own training programs for employees to fill these gaps</p>
